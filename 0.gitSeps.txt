=== STEPS FOR USING GIT ===
1. git init -- must be run in the folder that we want to add to the repository 
2. git add fileName or git add . (to add all the files) -- git works in two stages: stage and commit so in order to commit a file we
first have to mark it as staged using the add command.
2.1. git status -- to see what files have been staged for commit
3. git commit -m "first commit" -- this is the command that will actually going to create the commit which can be later uploaded to GitHub.com 
4. git branch -M main -- this command is creating a new branch which is called main (can use any name for branches)
5. git remote add origin https://github.com/cbuzuloiu/AlgorithmsAndDataStructures.git -- this command is creating the remote repository which is on GitHub.com - it creates the link to the local machine 
6. git push -u origin main -- upload our commit

=== CLONING A REPOSITORY ===
git clone https://github.com/cbuzuloiu/AlgorithmsAndDataStructures.git

=== PULL FROM A REPOSITORY ===
git pull origin main

=== SHORT VERSION ==
git add .
git status
git commit -m "commit"
git push -u origin main
